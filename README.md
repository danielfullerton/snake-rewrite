# Snake Rewrite

I originally attempted to write the classic game "Snake" in 2016, 
before I entered my professional career as a software developer. Back then, my code
was sloppy, inconsistent, totally un-scalable/maintainable, and ignored best practices as well
as modern patterns. I took the opportunity to rewrite Snake, focusing specifically on the
functional implementation (i.e. the game itself will not look pretty, but the code will!)

This project was written for fun and to see what my coding instincts would look like 4 years
later when writing the same project. The original source files can be found in */original*, all
else will be where you expect it. Feel free to clone and play the game!

## Prerequisites
To run the program locally, you will need:
* npm 
* nodejs

## Getting Started

    $ git clone https://github.com/danielfullerton/snake-rewrite.git
    $ cd snake
    $ npm install
    $ npm run start:dev

_(Windows commands will differ slightly)_

After running the above, you can access the program at http://localhost:4200.
